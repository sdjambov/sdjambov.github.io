<p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to my web page! I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href='https://www.ladhyx.polytechnique.fr/en/'>LadHyX</a>, working with <a href='https://ejambonpuillet.wordpress.com'>Etienne Jambon-Puillet</a>. Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in Mechanics under the supervision of Prof. François Gallaire in the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi'>Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities</a> at <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en'>EPFL</a>. The scope of <a href='https://infoscience.epfl.ch/handle/20.500.14299/255699'>my thesis</a> lies at the intersection of the hydrodynamic stability of thin-film flows, coupled to heat and/or mass transfer, and geomorphogenesis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I am originally from Sofia and presently based in Paris-Saclay. Before my doctoral studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Physics from <a href='https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en'>Université de Bordeaux</a>, followed by a Master's degree in Fundamental Physics and Applications from <a href='https://univ-cotedazur.eu'>Université Côte d'Azur</a>. As part of my doctoral studies, I carried out a six-month long mobility stay with Prof. Sylvain Courrech du Pont in the <a href='https://msc.u-paris.fr'>Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes</a> in Paris.</p>

> <p style="text-align: justify">It's even better to gaze into a tub of water. To look at water is always good for you and edifying. Even if you can't see anything in it, it's still good. We looked at the water and saw nothing in it, and soon we got bored. But we comforted ourselves that still we had done a good deed. We counted on our fingers. But what were we counting — we didn't know; for is water in any way countable?</p>

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

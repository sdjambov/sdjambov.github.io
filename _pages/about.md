<p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to my web page! I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanics under the supervision of Prof. François Gallaire in the <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lfmi'>Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics and Instabilities</a> at <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en'>EPFL</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of the hydrodynamic stability of thin-film flows, coupled to heat and/or mass transfer, and geo-morphogenesis.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I am originally from Sofia and presently based between Paris and Lausanne. Before starting my doctorate, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics from <a href='https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/en'>Université de Bordeaux</a>, followed by a Master's degree in Fundamental Physics and Applications from <a href='https://univ-cotedazur.eu'>Université Côte d'Azur</a>. As part of my doctoral studies, I carried out a six-month long mobility stay with Prof. Sylvain Courrech du Pont in the <a href='https://msc.u-paris.fr'>Laboratoire Matière et Systèmes Complexes</a> in Paris.</p>

> <p style="text-align: justify">It's even better to gaze into a tub of water. To look at water is always good for you and edifying. Even if you can't see anything in it, it's still good. We looked at the water and saw nothing in it, and soon we got bored. But we comforted ourselves that still we had done a good deed. We counted on our fingers. But what were we counting — we didn't know; for is water in any way countable?</p>

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

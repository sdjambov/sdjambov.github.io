<div style="text-align: justify">I am pleased to attend this year's <a href='https://summit.aps.org'>APS Global Physics Summit</a> (Anaheim CA, March 16â€“21). A collaboration with Loup Hasbroucq and Sylvain Courrech du Pont has resulted in two contributed talks on rain-driven dissolution. Find our abstracts <a href='https://schedule.aps.org/smt/2025/events/MAR-M66/11'>here</a> and <a href='https://schedule.aps.org/smt/2025/events/MAR-C66/8'>here</a>.</div>

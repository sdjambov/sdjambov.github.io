As my doctoral mobility stay in <a href='https://msc.u-paris.fr'>MSC</a> concludes, I want to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Sylvain Courrech du Pont and to all labmates for their warm welcome; special thanks to Loup Hasbroucq, Martin Chaigne, Emilien Dilly, Stanisław Żukowski, Grégoire Le Lay, Michaël Berhanu, Dražen Zanchi, and Stéphane Douady. To work alongside such talented individuals has made the last six months a truly invaluable experience.
